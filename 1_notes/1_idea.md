We recently had a workshop on domain driven design, where I we really mixed together OOP and DDD. Since in our Project we are thinking about moving towards a more functional architecture, I asked, how the process of modelling that we did in the workshop would work with that. Two claims were made:

1. Domain Driven Design is necessarily object oriented
2. Other approaches are inherently less efficient to maintain and extend.

I think I know where those ideas come from. I think a lot of early DDD Books are very Java/DDD centric, so that may be why.

I want to go into these two claims and work out my differences with them.
