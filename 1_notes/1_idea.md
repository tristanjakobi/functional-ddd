We recently had a workshop on domain driven design, where I felt the person running the workshop really mixed together OOP and DDD. Since in our Project we are thinking about moving towards a more functional architecture, I asked, how the process of modelling that we did in the workshop would work with that. He said two things:

1. Domain Driven Design is necessarily object oriented
2. Other approaches are inherently less efficient to maintain and extend.

I think I know where those ideas come from. Since I did not want to derail the Workshop, and openly question his Methods. 

Since he is a Java Developer, I assume he is not too familiar with functional Programming. Which is fine, that does not decredit his DDD Method or his Workshop. I think a lot of early DDD Books are very Java/DDD centric, so that may be why.

I want to go into these two claims and work out my differences with them.
